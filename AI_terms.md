# AI Terms

This file lists 20 important AI terms with short descriptions.

1. Computer Vision - a field of artificial intelligence that enables a computer program to "see" and interpret information from images. It includes tasks such as image classification, object detection, segmentation, tracking, video action analysis, and more.
2. Image Classification - a computer vision task in which a model assigns an image to a class (e.g., "cat," "dog," or "person").
3. Object Detection - a computer vision task in which a model detects and localizes objects in an image using bounding boxes.
4. Image Segmentation - a computer vision task in which a model divides an image into regions on a pixel-by-pixel basis.
5. YOLO (You Only Look Once) - a popular model for real-time computer vision. It performs detection, classification, segmentation, and other tasks, and processes them extremely quickly.
6. Natural Language Processing (NLP) - a field of artificial intelligence focused on understanding human language and performing text-based operations. It includes tasks such as speech recognition, machine translation, text generation, sentiment analysis, annotation, and much more.
7. Fraud Detection - models for detecting suspicious or anomalous actions that can identify fraudulent activity.
8. Large Language Models (LLMs) - very large language neural networks trained on very large amounts of text, capable of natural language processing, question answering, and various language tasks.
9. Fast Nearest-Neighbor - algorithms and data structures (FAISS, Annoy, HNSW) that enable efficient searches for elements most similar to a given vector, especially in large embedding databases.
10. Unsupervised Anomaly Detection — methods for identifying unusual or rare patterns in data without pre-labeled anomaly examples.
11. Generative AI — models capable of generating new data, such as text, images, and videos, based on previously trained datasets.
12. Hallucination — a situation where a model generates incorrect or fictitious information not based on real information.
13. Demand Forecasting — the use of statistical and ML models to predict future demand for services or products.
14. Multi-echelon Optimization Complexity — optimization problems in supply chains involving multiple tiers (suppliers → distribution centers → stores), where complexity increases dramatically due to interdependencies, demand stochasticity, and resource constraints.
15. Real-time Control — systems and models capable of making decisions in real time and with minimal response latency. Used in robotics, autonomous vehicles, and process control.
16. Simulation-to-Reality Transfer — methods that allow algorithms trained in simulation (where training is cheap and safe) to be transferred to real devices, minimizing the gap between simulation and real-world conditions.
17. Preventing Inappropriate Content — methods of filtering, classifying, and regulating the output of models to avoid generating toxic, dangerous, or norm-violating content.
18. False Positives — instances of evaluation where a model incorrectly labels a normal object as inappropriate or misclassifies it.
19. Echo Chambers — an effect in which recommendation algorithms amplify messages from only certain viewpoints, leading to the isolation of the user in an information bubble.
20. Reinforcing Popularity Bias — a situation where algorithms (e.g., recommender systems) more often show already popular content, thereby further increasing its popularity and suppressing lesser-known options.
